        Sports play an important role in the life of millions across the globe. Not only are the social and 
        political identities shaped through them, but it also mobilizes the emotions and channels the conflicts rooted
        in the society. Just like the soccer world cup can unite a divided Spanish society, a cricket match can 
        rouse the passions of the thousands of fans thus uniting them across the globe. 
        Cricket is one of the sports that have been elevated to being a part of the popular culture and 
        it influences the cultural and social milieu and the life of people.

            <h3>Players' union slams Cricket Australia's cost-cutting amid Covid-19 crisis</h3>
            <p>
                The chairman of Australia’s professional cricketers’ union has lambasted the national board’s
                cost-cutting measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying they could have “disastrous”
                consequences for the game over the long term.
                Cricket Australia stood down about 80% of its staff and said it had suffered a $20m fall in revenue 
                due to Covid-19, despite the pandemic hitting at the end of the season.The board is also pushing 
                member states to agree cuts to their grants and is in talks with players about adjusting pay.

            <h3>ICC says it is all right to use sweat to polish cricket ball but not saliva</h3>
            <p>
                The message from the International Cricket Council was clear: no more boiled sweets, but sweat is fine.
                The cricket committee, which is chaired by the former India spin bowler Anil Kumble, has decided to 
                recommend that the use of saliva to polish a cricket ball should be prohibited for the foreseeable future.
                By contrast the medical advice is that it is highly unlikely that coronavirus can be transmitted through
                sweat and the committee saw no need to prohibit the use of sweat to polish the ball. These regulations
                require bowlers – as well as the designated ball-shiner of every Test team – to change the habits of a 
                lifetime and not to lick their fingers upon receipt of the cricket ball.

            <h3>England coach Rob Ahmun: 'Some players will return in best shape of their life'</h3>
            <p>
                As England’s cricketers make their first tentative steps towards the nets after eight weeks at home, the 
                fitness coach who has been chivvying them along remotely believes some may return in the best shape of their career.
                When the Test tour to Sri Lanka was abandoned in March and the squad flew home to find Boris Johnson locking down 
                the country, the director of England cricket, Ashley Giles, tasked his strength and conditioning lead, Rob Ahmun, 
                with keeping the troops active and stated publicly there would be “no excuses” for a drop in standards.
                Ahmun rallied quickly before colleagues in the performance department, including his fellow strength and 
                conditioning coach Phil Scott, began to get furloughed. They sent kettlebells, resistance bands and 
                medicine balls (for the bowlers) to the 21 centrally contracted men’s cricketers, as well as drawing up personalised
                plans based on playing roles, injury history and lifestyle.

            <h3>Australia's July cricket tour unlikely to go ahead with UK restrictions still in place</h3>
            <p>
                Hopes of Australia’s white-ball tour of England taking place are looking increasingly unlikely after the 
                prime minister Boris Johnson put the brakes on any imminent return for professional sport. In a TV address
                on Sunday, Johnson said the coronavirus transmission rate was still too high to significantly ease the lockdown.
                Sport in the UK has been at a standstill for almost two months but Premier League clubs are expected to vote on 
                plans to complete the season at neutral venues at a meeting on Monday. But with Watford, Norwich, Brighton and
                Aston Villa already voicing opposition to the plan, the prospect of the 2019-20 season being put on hold for
                an extended period or even voided still remains.

            <h3>Afghanistan cricketer Shafiqullah Shafaq gets six-year ban for corruption</h3>
            <p>
                The Afghanistan wicketkeeper-batsman Shafiqullah Shafaq has been given a six-year ban after he 
                accepted four charges of breaching their anti-corruption code.The charges relate to offences during 
                the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League T20 in 2018 when Shafaq played for the 
                Nangarhar Leopards, and the 2019 Bangladesh Premier League when he represented Sylhet Thunder.
                The 30-year-old, who made his Afghanistan debut in 2009 and has played 24 one-day internationals 
                and 46 Twenty20 internationals, will be banned from all forms of cricket.
                “This is a very serious offence where a senior national player is involved in the corruption 
                of a high-profile domestic game,” said Sayed Anwar Shah Quraishi, the Afghanistan Cricket Board’s 
                senior anti-corruption manager.
                Quraishi said Shafaq’s admission of guilt and cooperation had helped him avoid a longer ban. 
                Shafaq will be involved with the ACB’s integrity education programmes to help younger players.
