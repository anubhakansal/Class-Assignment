    <h2>Basketball Frenzy</h2>
    <p>
        Sports plays an important role in the life of millions across the globe. Not only are the social and 
        political identities shaped through them, but it also mobilizes the emotions and channels the conflicts rooted
        in the society. Just like the cricket world cup can unite a divided Spanish society, a basketball match can 
        rouse the passions of the thousands of fans thus uniting them across the globe. 
        Basketball is one of the sports that have been elevated to being a part of the popular culture and 
        it influences the cultural and social milieu and the life of people.

                <h3>ESPN accused of fat-shaming Zion Williamson during electric NBA debut</h3>
                <p>
                    No sooner had the Duke product taken a seat on the bench after missing his 
                    lone attempt from the field did the conversation in the booth turn to Williamson’s fitness.
                    “Analysts Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy did not take long to go there,” the New York Post wrote
                    in their assessment. “The duo said it was clear that Williamson looked heavier than the last time 
                    they had seen him and that he needed to trim down after the 44-game absence to start his NBA career.
                    They continued that they could not believe he had gained eight pounds in a week after resuming
                    working out and questioned whether 285 pounds was even accurate.”
                    NBA Twitter, a community that helps shape the league’s narratives, was quick to call out the network, 
                    seizing on an on-screen graphic that informed the audience that Williamson is the third-heaviest player
                    in the NBA this season.

                <h3>Warriors' Stephen Curry Says He Was 1st NBA Player Tested for the Coronavirus</h3>
                <p>
                    The NBA season was suspended March 11 after Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus, 
                    but Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry was apparently the first player to be tested, five days
                    earlier. In an essay for Time, Curry explained he received a test March 6 after he felt sick with a fever 
                    that reached 101 degrees.
                    "I was the first NBA player tested for COVID-19," he wrote. "Thankfully, my test came back negative. 
                    But that experience hit me, and it hit me hard."
                    Curry has since used his time and money to help those affected by the coronavirus.Curry and his wife, Ayesha,
                    pledged one million meals through their Eat.Learn.Play. foundation to families affected by school closures 
                    throughout Oakland. He also plans to provide 300,000 meals to Oakland residents every week for the next few months.

                <h3>Michael Jordan burned bridges, LeBron James builds them. I know who I prefer</h3>
                <p>
                    I am hard pressed to name another athlete who has dominated my life quite like Michael Jeffrey Jordan.
                    When ESPN announced plans for The Last Dance documentary, I felt vindicated. Here, at last, was the
                    Air-tight argument that would put basketball’s all important greatest of all time debate to rest. 
                    LeBron James stans would have no choice but to bow down to the man who unironically calls himself “Black Jesus”.
                    James is the single greatest success story in team sports, a child prodigy who not only overcame the 
                    hardscrabble circumstances of his youth but fulfilled every expectation that was ever foisted upon him. 
                    And then he went well beyond even that. He forced his high school friends on his early money minders, and 
                    today they are part of his billion-dollar enterprise.
