    <h2>Football Paradise</h2>
    <p>
        As any fan will know, football is much more than just a game of two halves – it is a way of life, a culture and,
     above all, a deep passion. As such, everyone has their own opinion on all aspects of the beautiful game, from last
      weekend’s action to who the prime candidates for the title and relegation are. Usually they aren’t afraid to 
      express it either! There was a time when football discussions would take place in pubs, households,
       and workplaces – and they still do – except now there’s a new platform on the scene: blogs.
       <br/><br/><strong>So here are some intersting blogs for all the football lovers :-</strong>

            <h3>The Run Of Play</h3>
            <p>
                One of the best designed blogs on the list, this is "a blog about the wonder and terror of soccer". That tells you where the blog is based, 
                but it covers far more than just MLS. Here are just two examples why you should read it.

            <p>
                Another blog with a fine podcast, "the opinions here range from the extremely cynical to 
                the gloriously bright-eyed,from Premier League title race excitement to bitter non-league conversion".

            <p>
                "Beer is the medium. Soccer is the message," is this blog's mantra as it downs one blog 
                on US football before swiftly moving on to another.
