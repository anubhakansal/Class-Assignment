                <h3>Should Liverpool deserve EPL title!!</h3>
                <p>
                    Since the season was suspended last month due to the coronavirus pandemic, a number of huge decisions
                    have been made regarding various events.Euro 2020 has been delayed until the summer of 2021, whilst 
                    UEFA have decided that the club season must finish by June 30th, leaving the possibility that leagues
                    could be cancelled if they can't be finished by that time frame.
                    And now, the European football's governing body have insisted that the 2019/20 campaign would be 
                    settled on "sporting merit" if games can't be finished,which means the results so far will help decide
                    the final standings.Liverpool are currently 25 points clear in the Premier League title race, and have 
                    only managed to drop points on two occasions all season.It is also likely that Champions League.

                <h3>How IPL affected BCCI!!</h3>
                <p>
                    Indian cricket fans could finally have news to rejoice as fresh media reports suggest that the Board of 
                    Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is keen on getting IPL 2020 underway in the September-November 
                    window. IPL 2020 was slated to start from March 29 this year. But with the outbreak of the coronavirus
                    pandemic, the BCCI suspended it indefinitely.
                    However, if the tournament gets cancelled completely, BCCI will have to incur huge losses and 
                    now reports in the media suggest that the board is keen on hosting the tournament September 25 to 
                    November 1, provided the country is able to lower the rate of coronavirus infections.

                <h3>Would have LeBron James won NBA MVP!!</h3>
                <p>
                    LeBron James continues to defy any realistic expectation for what should be possible by a player in his 
                    17th season and playing at a level that once more begs the question as to how he hasn't been named 
                    the NBA's Most Valuable Player since way back in 2012-13 with the Miami Heat.It's a streak that appears 
                    likely to continue as Antetokounmpo rampages through the Eastern Conference with a historic campaign on a team 
                    that still might reach the mystical 70-win threshold.
                    There's little doubt that Milwaukee's 25-year-old superstar is the overwhelming favourite 
                    and for good reason.
